Right now this doesn't do much.

Usage:
node kn.js <term1> <term2>?

It has a fixed training library in kn.js.  If it recognizes a unigram or bigram, above it will return probabilities
for the next term.  For example

$ node kn.js read a
test { keys: [ 3496342, 97 ] }
	match: book  -1.3048210220594094
	match: different  -1.4544591329755712
	match: magazine  -2.008216259092102
	match: tome  -2.3413840873945273

If the terms you try aren't in the dictionary yet (training set) you'll see undefined in one or both of the test:keys
printout.  Right now there isn't a way to add to the training set or really to interact much with the KN language model.

This is a port of Brian Romanowski's open source Kneser-Ney language model according to Chen and Goodman's kneser-ney-mod-fix
description, originally written in Java, now for nodejs using the 'natural' npm package.  See copyright below:
